I am a 3rd-year PhD student in the `School of Engineering and Applied Sciences <https://www.seas.harvard.edu/>`_ at Harvard University. I have a strong interest in `Computational Science and Engineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science>`_ and am acquainted with high-performance computing (HPC), numerical methods, machine learning algorithms and frameworks, software engineering practices, and atmospheric and environmental modeling.

My PhD is supported by the `NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship <https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-stats/nasa-earth-and-space-science-fellowship-nessf-selections>`_, with a main focus on developing Earth Science Models (specifically the NASA-supported `GEOS-Chem <http://www.geos-chem.org>`_ model) on cloud computing platforms, to accelerate time-to-science for thousands of scientific users worldwide. The project is also generously supported by the `AWS Cloud Credits for Research <https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/>`_ and the `AWS Open Data Project <https://aws.amazon.com/opendata/>`_. I have interned at `Google Accelerated Science <https://ai.google/research/teams/applied-science/gas/>`_ working on machine learning and physical sciences.
